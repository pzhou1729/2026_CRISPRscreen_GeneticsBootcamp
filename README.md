# Analyzing CRISPR screen data

This repository contains material for the HMS Genetics Bootcamp held on January 13, 2026.

## Why study CRISPR screening?
CRISPR technologies have revolutionized modern genetics by enabling precise, programmable manipulation of the genome. High-throughput CRISPR platforms support 
systematic gene perturbations, including knockout, knockdown, and overexpression. Coupled with nextgeneration sequencing, these approaches enable quantitative phenotypic readouts at scale. Nextgeneration genome editing technologies such as base and prime editing extend this framework to singlenucleotide resolution, providing deeper insights into the genetic variants that shape complex traits. This 
workshop introduces the design principles and uses cases of CRISPR screening, and provides hands-on experience analyzing screen data, interpreting genetic effects, and generating testable hypotheses. 

In this workshop, students will discuss screens performed by the lab and in the scientific literature. Finally, students will participate in two dry lab sessions where they will 1) get exposed to the computational 
tools that can inform target selection and library design and 2) explore gene targeting and variant scanning CRISPR screening datasets.
